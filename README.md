# RadialBasis-Neural-Net
An implementation of an RBF layer/module using PyTorch. RBF layers are an alternative to the activation functions used in regular artificial neural networks. Typically, each RBF layer in an RBF network is followed by a linear layer.

Features

A radial basis function (RBF) layer followed by Linear layer you can manupulate Layers by Layer Size parameter.
Centres and scaling factors trained by gradient descent rather than clustering
